## Statistical/ Machine Learning Identifies a Novel Gene Signature that Predicts Breast Cancer Survival using a Risk Score Model
Breast cancer is the one of the most prevalent cancers globally and bears a
substantial disease burden. Given the heterogeneity of breast cancer, predicting breast
cancer survival is important to facilitate personalised clinical decisions and treatments. In
recent years, the advent of artificial intelligence and the emergence of high-dimensional
genetic data hold promise in improving survival prediction. This study aims to utilise
statistical/ machine learning to identify a novel subset of genes to construct a risk score
model that predicts breast cancer survival via a hypothesis-free, data-driven approach.
